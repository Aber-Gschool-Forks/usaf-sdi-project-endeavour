# BrewList Readme

We've all been there.  You are traveling and you want to go see some breweries in your destination, but you also want to be mindful of your per diem.  We got a solution, BrewList.  Simply put in your destination zip code OR your city  + state and you'll get a list of local breweries and your daily per diem (as applicable).  
This was created using the create-react-app command so the typical npm run / npm test / npm killallhumans commands work.
